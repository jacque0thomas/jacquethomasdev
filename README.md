# Personal Website

I've undertaken a journey to create that fabled self-marketing essential, that oft-reviewed branding technique, of a personal website. 

## Experience Gained
I decided to start this journey from scratch, hopefully learning a lot about **Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS** and the way (and maybe expand a bit on my knowledge of **Javascript, Ruby, and Git**).

## Initial Architectural Concept
At the point of starting, I've decided to anchor my personal website in my hobbies, starting with event planning.

## Plan of Attack
First, I'll be creating the basics: an About Me page, a Contact, a link to my resume. Next, I plan to tackle a personal blog for my event planning hobby. I can get a bit... overboard when planning something, but honestly, I see that a plus. It's important for me to create meaningful and interesting experiences in safe spaces for my group of friends, most of whom are LGBTQ+.
